# SetWar
A spin on the classic game of Set.

# How the game is played:

- To Start, the cards are dealt to the players one at a time starting with Player 0 until all cards are dealt. It is possible that one player gets an extra card.

- Player 0 goes first, followed by Player 1, and so on. The order then cycles back to player 0. 

- On a player's turn, they take the top card from their pile and place it on the table. The cards on the table are laid out in a line so the ordering is evident. These cards are called the line.

- If the card is played that forms a set with two other cards in the line, the player who put the last card down wins all the cards in the line. The cards from the line are stacked so they maintain their order (first card played is on top) and they are placed on the bottom of that player's pile. 

- The player to win the round is the first to put down in the start of the next round.

- If a player plays their last card, and that card does not form a set (i.e. they don't win the round on that play), then that player is out of the game. If that leaves only one player, then the round is over and the last player wins the pile.

- If there is only one player left, that player is the winner.
